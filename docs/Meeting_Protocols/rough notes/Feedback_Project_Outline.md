# Project Outline

## Feedback

- Bad table formatting
- Not necessary: The player exits the game, etc.
- System requirements not game rules (forbid moving out of track)
  - Main game rules in the main use case
- UML possible to split development -> not really possible?
  - need use cases to assign tasks
- Use cases for demonstration? or like that
- Risks not really risks -> real risks can demolish our development
  - new rules/festures can ruin the game by making it unfun
  - can try them out on paper
  - Corona virus not good :(
- Review use cases in general
  - Should give the customer a value
  - Set priorities
  - -> edit rough timeline
- Some use cases can be combined (not really uses cases on their own
- Set game options can be multiple use cases -> choose track 
- Profitablility, how did the costs get calculated?
- Glossary, only terms which are not googable!
