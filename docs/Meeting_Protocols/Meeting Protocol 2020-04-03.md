## ✏️ Agenda

### Software Architecture

- Who is the first player? the first player has an advantage and could be the first who crosses the line
  - How to handle this?
- 

### Design Artifacts

- It's allowed to generate diagrams (e.g. via IntelliJ), especially later in the *Implementation Phase*.
  - It may be necessary to simplify those generated diagrams, as those can be overloaded with information and details.

### Use Case Model

- System sequence diagram for UC13 (Load Track) can begin with the *selectFile()* action.

- Additional classes in the system sequence diagrams aren't actors, as they aren't running in separated threads.
- A system sequence diagram usually shows the action of one thread and starts with an action from a user.

### General

- Next week no status meeting because of *Good Friday*.
- Presentation of *Solution Architecture* with demo in a fortnight.
- Upload of files a day before.

- Questions can be asked via email.
