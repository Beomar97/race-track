# Competition Analysis

Research has shown that the game Racetrack, also known as Vector Race, has never been realized as a computer desktop game [1] [2]. Currently, two Android applications with the same concept as RaceTrack are distributed on the Google Play Store [3]. However, these are not suitable for multiplayer or educational purposes, as the screen size is limited by the smartphone.

Thanks to the implementation with the programming language Java, RaceTrack is platform-independent. This gives the user the advantage of running RaceTrack game on Windows, macOS or Linux.  In addition, a larger audience is reached and therewith a larger potential of paying customers.

RaceTrack distinguishes itself by adding the option to add special items to the track, e.g. boosts or obstacles. This feature can be activated during the creation of the game round.
