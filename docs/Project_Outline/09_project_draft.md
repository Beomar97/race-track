# Project Draft

The first release with basic functionality will be given a development period of twelve weeks. The development occurs iterative and incremental in accordance with the Unified Software Development Process. Following use cases and risks have been evaluated in a first round of evaluation:

## Use Cases

<!-- //TODO edit use cases after new use cases have been defined -->

- Use Case UC1: View Highscore
<!-- - Use Case UC2: View Rules -->
<!--- Use Case UC3: View Credits -->
- Use Case UC4: Set Game Options (after starting game)
<!--- Use Case UC5: Start new Round of Game -->
<!--- Use Case UC6: Reset Round of Game -->
- **Use Case UC7: Play one Round of Game**
<!--- Use Case UC8: Exit Game -->
<!-- - Use Case UC9: Compare with Highscore (after one Round of Game)-->
- Use Case UC10: Load Game
- Use Case UC11: Save Game
<!--- Use Case UC12: Start Game -->

## Risks and Prevention

//TODO add additional technical risks if any come up

- Implementation of GUI unfamiliar
- Used programming language (Java) not optimised for game development

- A developer will assure that he gains the necessary knowledge of Java graphical user interface (GUI) development. He may or may not use a GUI Framework.

## Rough Timeline

//TODO Edit timeline with real use cases with importance

400 - 500 man hours are estimated for the creation of the first version. The game will be developed in iterations of two weeks during a development period of twelve weeks after following timeline:

| Phase         | Iteration | Start/Duration[Week] | Goals                                                        |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Inception     | 1         | 1 / 2                | Project draft created, use cases defined, domain model drafted, development pipeline set up finished, architecture drafted |
| **Milestone** | **M1**    | **End of week 2**    | **Vision, goals and requirements defined**                   |
| Elaboration   | 2         | 3 / 2                | First half of use cases specified in detail, other requirements identified and prioritised, UI prototype present, architecture stable |
|               | 3         | 5 / 2                | Second half of use cases specified in detail, domain model finalised, architecture stable and as PoC verified |
| **Milestone** | **M2**    | **End of week 6**    | **Architecture verified**                                    |
| Construction  | 4         | 7 / 2                | Use cases for iteration realised and tested, UI prototype implemented |
|               | 5         | 9 / 2                | Use cases for iteration realised and tested, UI updated      |
|               | 6         | 11 / 2               | Use cases for iteration realised and tested, UI updated      |
| **Milestone** | **M3**    | **End of week 12**   | **First version realised and released with tests and documentation** |
