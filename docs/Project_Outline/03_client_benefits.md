# Client Benefits

RaceTrack brings multiple benefits to its users/players:

* The player can play the game either with friends or alone.
* No paper is needed and wasted. Instead, larger computer screens ensure better visibility than on a sheet of paper.
* A game can be restarted with the same settings (e.g. same number of players, same track, same cars, etc.)
* The players can compare their scores with previous players
* There's also an educational aspect where players can learn about the concept of vectors and vector addition:
  * The player can train his reasoning abilities by playing the game and see dependencies with other vectors.
  * It can even help to improve decision-making skills.
