The development of RaceTrack will be split between 4 programmers. Every member of the development team needs to have advanced knowledge in programming with Java. With the use cases, it is possible to split the tasks and resources between the developers. Also, knowledge in vector mathematics is needed to know possible directions for the car in the next turn.

Every developer needs a working computer to build and test the game. Git is used as a version control system and to track the project status. 400 to 500 man-hours are projected to be needed to develop the game and manage the project.
