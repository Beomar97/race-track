# Project Management

Listing of the rough timeline with previous and future iterations. The planned expenditure and goals are listed together with the actual expenditure and achieved goals per iteration. After each iteration an iteration-assessment is being created, where reached goals are analysed and additional measures may be defined. The detailed planning for next iterations and risks will be constantly updated.
