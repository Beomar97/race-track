		All of the teams' original goals for this project have been achieved, better put all planned use cases for this project have been implemented:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Main Use Cases:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \includegraphics[width=0.3cm,keepaspectratio]{img/"Icon_White Heavy Check Mark".png} Use Case UC7: Play one Game Session \\
				A round of RaceTrack can successfully be played with up to four people simultaneously. The track is being recognized correctly and the velocities gained are also calculated accurately. The crossing of the finish line is recognized error-free, too.
				\item \includegraphics[width=0.3cm,keepaspectratio]{img/"Icon_White Heavy Check Mark".png} Use Case UC13: Load Track \\
				Additional custom tracks, which comply with all the rules for a custom track, can be imported without a hassle. Invalid tracks are correctly refused with an appropriate error message. Tracks can be deleted too, except for the default tracks in the game.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Secondary Use Cases:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \includegraphics[width=0.3cm,keepaspectratio]{img/"Icon_White Heavy Check Mark".png} Use Case UC1: View High Score \\
				The high score of each track and game mode can successfully be displayed, this is also true for additionally added custom tracks. The correct track and game mode is also displayed correctly after the end of a game session.
				\item \includegraphics[width=0.3cm,keepaspectratio]{img/"Icon_White Heavy Check Mark".png} Use Case UC4: Set Game Options \\
				Game options before starting a new game can accurately be set and the new game starts with the correct configuration. The game starts correctly with the precise number of players entered.
				\item \includegraphics[width=0.3cm,keepaspectratio]{img/"Icon_White Heavy Check Mark".png} Use Case UC10: Load Game Session \\
				A previously saved game session (\textit{.rtsave} file) can be imported into the game error-free with the exact game state as before the save. The continued game session behaves without any errors or anomalies.
				\item \includegraphics[width=0.3cm,keepaspectratio]{img/"Icon_White Heavy Check Mark".png} Use Case UC11: Save Game Session \\
