\section{Open Issues}
	Currently, there are only two unresolved issues still open for RaceTrack:
	\begin{itemize}
		 \item A confirmation should be needed before the system resets a running game session.
		 \item The game should be restartable after the High Score window is being displayed.
	\end{itemize}
