	\section{Project Management}
		Listing of the rough timeline of the iterations. The planned expenditure and goals are listed together with the actual expenditure and achieved goals per iteration. After each iteration an iteration-assessment is being created, where reached goals are analyzed and additional measures may be defined. The detailed planning for the next iterations and risks have been constantly updated.
