\section{Code Quality}
	RaceTrack is being developed using the leading cloud-based solution for continuous analysis of code quality, reliability, and security \textbf{SonarCloud}. Not only does \textbf{SonarCloud} automatically detect bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells and, other issues, it also elevates the team's coding quality to a new standard.

	RaceTrack currently maintains the highest Reliability Rating \textcolor{ForestGreen}{A}, the highest Security Rating \textcolor{ForestGreen}{A} and an outstanding Test Coverage of \textcolor{ForestGreen}{81.5\%}, and all of that still in the Beta Phase, with only room for further improvement.
