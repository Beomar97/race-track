\section{Resources}
	The development of RaceTrack will be split between 4 programmers. Every member of the development team needs to have advanced knowledge in programming with Java. With the use cases, it is possible to split the tasks and resources between the developers. Also, knowledge in vector mathematics is needed to know possible directions for the car in the next turn.

	Every developer needs a working computer to build and test the game. Git is used as a version control system and GitHub (hosted by ZHAW) as a remote repository, with this configuration, changes can be easily tracked, retraced and reverted if necessary. The project status is being tracked by using the \textit{Projects} function in GitHub using \gls{Kanban} boards. \textit{\gls{Azure Pipelines}} and \textit{\gls{SonarCloud}} are used for \textit{\gls{Continous Integration and Deployment}} and ensuring code quality and security respectively. 400 to 500 man-hours are projected to be needed for developing the game and managing the project.
