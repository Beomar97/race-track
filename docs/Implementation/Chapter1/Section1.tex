\section{Baseline}
	In today's world, almost anything is being digitalised. \textbf{PathFinder} wants to bring childhood memories and the nostalgic game experience of the popular paper and pencil game mostly known as \textit{Racetrack} to the digital age. Not only can PathFinder and its partners turn a profit from this venture, but it can also reduce the general paper waste by providing a digital alternative to its original counterpart on paper.
