\section{Risks}
	Following risks have been identified:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Since PathFinder is an emerging startup, it does not offer the same expertise as established game development companies.
		\item Also, with a game like RaceTrack, the rules of the game must be well known to the player to ensure the \textit{fun} factor.
		\item With a small team consisting of only four developers, the temporary loss of a teammate due to illness or other diseases can heavily impact the progress of the project.
		\item Implementation of graphical user interfaces unfamiliar.
		\item The used programming language Java is not optimized for game development.
	\end{itemize}
