\section{Profitability}
	With the required man-hours multiplied by the salary, the development costs of the application RaceTrack is estimated at 60,000 Swiss Francs. Additionally, there will be expenses of 1'000 Swiss Francs for licenses and infrastructure. Since our game can be downloaded for free, our income is generated by \gls{microtransactions}. In future releases, users will be able to purchase \gls{add-ons} such as new race tracks or additional cars with striking looks. The prices for these \gls{add-ons} range from 2 to 15 Swiss Francs. With a predicted user base of 30'000 users and average revenue of 2 francs per installation, we expect the game to become profitable within a year.
